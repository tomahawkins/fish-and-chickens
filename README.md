# Fish and Chickens!

# Checklist

1. Turn on the sprinkler in the vegetable garden.  Leave it running while you're at the house.
2. If you see any packages in the front, please bring them into the garage.
3. **Fish:**
    1. Feed fish 1 cube of frozen food.
    2. Check that the water temperature is in the green: about 77 degrees F.
    3. Add pretreated water from buckets provided to bring the water level back up to tape mark on the tank.
    4. If water is flowing around and bypassing the filter the filter is starting to clog up
       and should be replaced.  Spare filters are above the tank on the shelf.
       The blue filter holder stays in the unit.  Hold this down while pulling up
       on the used filter tab that says "FRONT".
       Throw out the old filter, drop in a new one.  A new filter should
       last about a week.
    5. After a few days the tank glass will get coated with green algae.
       It looks gross, but the fish are perfectly fine.
       Actually water quality improves with algae growth.
4. **Chickens:**
    1. Check that the water container is at least half full.
    2. Check that the water container valves are working and not stuck open or stuck closed.
    3. Clean out debris from food dispenser and add new food so it is about half full.
    4. Leave a couple of cups of grubs on the ground in the run.
    5. Collect and return eggs to refrigerator.
    6. If you want to hang out for a bit, the birds would love to run around the backyard.
       They will forage around and take dust baths.  They will stay in the general area
       and you won't have to watch them too closely.  It can be somewhat of a hassle to get
       them back in the coop, so this is totally optional.  3 of the 4 birds are easy to pick
       up so I tend to just carry them back.
       However, the Barred Rock (gray and white) is hard
       to catch so I'll use the hockey stick to slowly coral her back to the coop.
       Open the door and she should walk right in.
       There's lots of entertaining YouTube videos on how to pick up a chicken:

    7. Squirrels have been digging holes to get into the coop.  If you see any, fill them back in with
       the shovel.  I reinforced the coop with rocks so hopefully this will be less of an issue.
    8. Make sure the coop door and hatches are secured when you leave.
5. Water the plants on and along the brick wall in front of the house.
6. When you leave, shut off the sprinkler in the vegetable garden.
