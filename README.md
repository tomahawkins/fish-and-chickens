# Fish and Chickens!

# Checklist

1. Turn on the sprinkler in the vegetable garden.  Leave it running while you're at the house.
2. Fish:
    1. Feed fish 1 cube of frozen food.
    2. Check that the water temperature is in the green: about 77 degrees F.
    3. Add pretreated water from buckets provided.  Bring water level back up to tape mark on the tank.
    4. If water is flowing around and bypassing the filter the filter is starting to clog up
       so replace the filter.  Spare filters are above the tank on the shelf.
       The blue filter holder stays in the unit.  Hold this down while pulling up
       on the used filter tab that says "FRONT".
    * After a few days the tank will start to get green with algae.  This is okay.
3. Chickens:
